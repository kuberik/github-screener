                        has more data available. The value is opaque and may be used
                        to issue another request to the endpoint that served this
                        list to retrieve the next set of available objects. Continuing
                        a consistent list may not be possible if the server configuration
                        has changed or more than a few minutes have passed. The resourceVersion
                        field returned when using this continue value will be identical
                        to the value in the first response, unless you have received
                        this token from an error message.

                        items in the list which are not included in this list response.
                        If the list request contained label or field selectors, then
                        the number of remaining items is unknown and the field will
                        be left unset and omitted during serialization. If the list
                        is complete (either because it is not chunking or because
                        this is the last chunk), then there are no more remaining
                        items and this field will be left unset and omitted during
                        serialization. Servers older than v1.15 do not set this field.
                        The intended use of the remainingItemCount is *estimating*
                        the size of a collection. Clients should not rely on the remainingItemCount
                        to be set or to be exact.
